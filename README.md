## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Honestly I learnt a lot, took me a lot of time to actually finish this. It was annoying, painful and quite difficult to understand. The use of grids is a little new to me and I would need constant practice to get better at it, especially grid responsiveness.


### Useful resources
